# Heart Disease Prediction Report

## Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are a major public health concern worldwide, and the ability to predict heart disease in individuals is crucial for early intervention and prevention. In this report, we present an analysis of heart disease prediction using data analysis and linear regression modeling. We utilize the R programming language and relevant libraries to explore the relationship between age and two key risk factors: resting blood pressure and serum cholesterol.

## Data Description

The dataset used for this analysis contains information related to heart disease, including patient age, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, and other variables. A summary of the dataset and its structure is provided below:

```R
# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv("D:\\R\\week 2\\heart disease\\heart_disease.csv")

# Summary of the dataset
summary(data)

# Structure of the dataset
str(data)
```

The summary and structure of the dataset provide us with insights into the data's characteristics and the types of variables available.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is a crucial step in understanding the relationships between variables. We use the `ggplot2` library to create scatter plots that visually represent the relationship between age and two risk factors: resting blood pressure and serum cholesterol.

### Age vs. Resting Blood Pressure

```R
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = age, y = resting_blood_pressure)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)
```

The scatter plot above shows how resting blood pressure varies with age. Additionally, a linear regression line is fitted to the data to capture the trend.

### Age vs. Serum Cholesterol

```R
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = age, y = serum_cholestoral)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)
```

Similarly, the scatter plot above visualizes the relationship between age and serum cholesterol levels, with a linear regression line for trend analysis.

## Linear Regression Model

To further understand the relationship between age and resting blood pressure, we create a linear regression model using the `lm()` function:

```R
# Linear regression model
regmodel1 <- lm(resting_blood_pressure ~ age, data = data)

# Coefficients and constant
coef(regmodel1)
```

The linear regression model helps us quantify the relationship between age and resting blood pressure, providing coefficients that indicate the strength and direction of the relationship.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this report demonstrates the use of data analysis and linear regression modeling to explore the prediction of heart disease based on age and two important risk factors: resting blood pressure and serum cholesterol. The visualizations and linear regression model provide valuable insights into how age correlates with these risk factors, aiding in the understanding and prediction of heart disease.

Further analysis and refinement of models can be performed to enhance the accuracy of heart disease prediction. This analysis serves as a foundational step in the broader effort to develop effective tools for cardiovascular disease risk assessment and prevention.
